## Enhancing Talent Development through AI-Powered Comparisons

The K-Transformer Model bridges the skill gap between college players and professional benchmarks. By providing precise player-template matching, it enables Northwestern coaches to tailor development programs that align with professional standards, offering actionable pathways for improvement.

## Actionable Player Analytics for Tactical Advantage

Multi-dimensional radar charts offer a holistic view of player performance, integrating stamina distribution and other kinematic insights. These charts allow coaches to identify individual strengths and weaknesses at a granular level, leading to informed tactical decisions.

## Streamlined Decision-Making with Performance Summaries

The Athletic KPI Evaluation System employs LLM-generated reports to provide coaches with easy-to-understand ratings and actionable next steps for players. This system helps coaches allocate resources efficiently by focusing on high-potential players or identifying areas for improvement.

## Maximizing Resource Efficiency

With limited resources and a competitive conference, the solution reduces the time required for manual player evaluations while enhancing decision accuracy, allowing the coaching staff to "do more with less."

## Data Accessibility for Coaches

The interactive webpage consolidates insights from tabular, video, and PDF data into an intuitive interface. By translating complex data into actionable insights, the webpage empowers coaches to make evidence-based decisions, improving data accessibility and usability.





## Functional Key Features

1. **K-Transformer Model for Player Template Matching**  
    Leverage an unsupervised ML approach aidded with a neural network autoencoder, enhanced with a customized loss function, to precisely match school players with professional templates, effectively bridging the gap between emerging talent and elite performance standards, and unlocking their limitless future potential.

2. **Multi-Dimensional Radar Chart for Each Player**  
   Design radar charts with 5 key metrics, each featuring 4-6 normalized attributes. These metrics are weighted using a customized Gaussian-log function to evaluate on-court performance, accounting for stamina distribution over time. The function is supported by kinematic studies and relevant literature.

3. **Athletic KPI Evaluation System**  
   Employ an LLM to generate comprehensive ratings and evaluations for players, with suggested next steps across five categories: *Outstanding*, *Regular*, *Needs Improvement in Specific Areas*, *Underperformed*, and *Farewell*.

4. **Intelligence Fuzzy Search System**
    An optimized webpage search system that allows flexible search inputs, accommodating full team names, nicknames, partial names, and displaying results for teams with identical names.



## Player Performance Radar Charts

We design a player performance matrix that can provide a visually captivating representation of player abilities, crafted to highlight strengths and areas of improvement across five distinct performance matrices. These charts are a powerful way to intuitively grasp the multifaceted attributes that contribute to a player's overall performance on the field.

### The Five Matrices

1. **Attacking Contribution**: This matrix captures offensive prowess, including goals, assists, shots on target, expected assists (xA), progressive runs, and crossing capabilities. It reflects the player's ability to contribute actively to scoring opportunities.

2. **Defensive Capability**: This matrix measures a player's defensive tenacity, encompassing key metrics like defensive duels, interceptions, tackles, and recoveries. It showcases the player's effectiveness in defending and regaining possession.

3. **Passing & Playmaking**: This matrix reveals a player's ability to move the ball efficiently and create scoring chances. It includes metrics such as total passes, forward passes, passes into the final third, and shot assists, emphasizing creativity and playmaking skills.

4. **Duels & Physical Presence**: This matrix focuses on a player's ability to dominate physical contests, including aerial and offensive duels, as well as fouls drawn and touches inside the box. It represents the player's assertiveness and ability to impose themselves in physical battles.

5. **Discipline & Goalkeeping**: This matrix provides a holistic view of discipline and goalkeeping capabilities, tracking fouls, yellow/red cards, as well as goalkeeping stats like saves and reflex saves. It offers insight into how well a player maintains composure and contributes defensively as a goalkeeper.

Each radar chart not only visualizes these metrics but also compares individual player performance to the baseline average, providing a clear, comparative perspective that helps understand the unique qualities of each player.



## Key Features
